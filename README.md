Backbone restful API library
============================

This is a personal customized version of the exercise 2 of Addy Osmani's excellent book : Developing Backbone.js Applications.


The exercise aim to show us how to build our first RestFul API in backbone using node.js.

I added:
 - requireJS to modularize my app,
 - Bootstrap v3 to make it look prettier :),
 - Handlebars for templating
